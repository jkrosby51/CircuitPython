## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code
Using CircuitPython to change the RGB value of the Metro Express neopixel.
```python
dot.fill((255,0,0))
```

### Wiring
N/A

### Reflection
Once the Metro was fully updated and the correct libraries were found, this assignment was easy.


## CircuitPython_Servo

### Description & Code
Using capacative touch to move a servo.

I used this part of the code in order to move the servo when the wires were touched, without letting the angle value go past 180 or 0.
```python
    if angle < 180 and touch1.value: 
        angle = angle + 5
        my_servo.angle = angle
        print("angle: ", angle)
    if angle > 0 and touch2.value:
        angle = angle - 5
        my_servo.angle = angle
        print("angle: ", angle)
```

### Reflection
Cap touch can be very useful for interaction (i.e. buttons) and is simple to code.


## CircuitPython_Distance_Sensor

### Description & Code
Translating Distance values from a hcsr04 to rgb values for a neopixel.

This section of the code was used to turn the Distance measurement to rgb values used to control the neopixel on the board.
```python
elif cm < 20:  # When within 19-5cm
 redValue = simpleio.map_range(cm, 5, 20, 255, 0)  # Closer = more red
 greenValue = 0
 blueValue = simpleio.map_range(cm, 5, 20, 0, 255)  # Further = more blue
 print("RGB: (", redValue, ", ", greenValue, ", ", blueValue, ")")
 dot.fill((int(redValue), int(greenValue), int(blueValue)))
elif cm < 35:  # When within 34-20cm
 redValue = 0
 greenValue = simpleio.map_range(cm, 20, 35, 0, 255)  # Further = more green
 blueValue = simpleio.map_range(cm, 20, 35, 255, 0)  # Closer = more blue
 print("RGB: (", redValue, ", ", greenValue, ", ", blueValue, ")")
 dot.fill((int(redValue), int(greenValue), int (blueValue)))
```

### Reflection
Simpleio Mapping can be useful for mapping values to different formats to be used as an input for another function. Keeping code organized makes it much easier to find errors and to avoid them in the first place.


## CircuitPython_Photointerrupter 

### Description & Code
This project counted how many times the photointeruppter detected interupts.

This part of the code was in charge of making sure that it only counted once per interrupt (as opposed to it counting every tick where there was something blocking the laser)
```python
photo = interrupter.value
    if photo and not state:
            counter += 1
    state = photo
```

### Wiring

### Reflection

The photointerrupter is a useful way to take inputs. In order to code the counter I had to make sure that it only counted when the sensor noticed a change in states, which I showed above.


## RGB Fading LED

### Description & Code
This assignment was to create a module with a class which could be used to make an RGB LED fade on and off.

This section of the rgb module made the given LED pin fade to max and then back to min.
```python
def fade(self):
        for i in range(255):
            if i < (128):       # First half of cycle, starts at zero brightness and moves up to 65535 (max).
                self.led.duty_cycle = int(i * 65535 / (255/2)) # fade off
            elif i == 128:      # Holds at max brightness for 1s
               time.sleep(1)
            else:               # Second half of cycle, starts at 65535 brightness (max) and moves down to zero.
                self.led.duty_cycle = 65535 - int((i-128) * 65535 / (255/2))

            time.sleep(0.01)    # Holds at min brightness for 1s
```

### Reflection

Modules and Classes are useful because they allow for simple repetition through the use of class objects to create variations of the original code without recoding anything.
