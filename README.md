## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code
Description goes here

Here's how you make code look like code:

```python
import board
import neopixel

dot = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.NEOPIXEL, 1)

print("Make it red!")

while True:
    dot.fill((255,0,0))

```

### Evidence
Pictures / Gifs of your work should go here

### Images
Make an account with your google ID at [tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits), and use "TinkerCad Circuits to make a wiring diagram."  It's really easy!  
Then post an image here.   [here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

### Reflection
Challenges with updates made it difficult to complete the assignment at first but when that was fixed it was easy.
