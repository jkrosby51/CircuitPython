### Evidence
Pictures / Gifs of your work should go here

### Images
Make an account with your google ID at [tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits), and use "TinkerCad Circuits to make a wiring diagram."  It's really easy!  
Then post an image here.   [here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)
