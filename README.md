## Hello_CircuitPython

### Description & Code
Make the neopixel red

[Full Code](https://github.com/jkrosby51/CircuitPython/blob/main/HelloWorld.py)

### Evidence
Pictures / Gifs of your work should go here

### Wiring
Make an account with your google ID at [tinkercad.com](https://www.tinkercad.com/learn/circuits), and use "TinkerCad Circuits to make a wiring diagram."  It's really easy!  
Then post an image here.   [here's a quick tutorial for all markdown code, like making links](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/)

### Reflection
Challenges with updates made it difficult to complete the assignment at first but when that was fixed it was easy.


## CircuitPython_Servo

### Description & Code
Using capacative touch to move a servo.

This code is for controlling the angle of the servo with the cap touch
```python
    if angle < 180 and touch1.value:
        angle = angle + 5
        my_servo.angle = angle
        print("angle: ", angle)
    if angle > 0 and touch2.value:
        angle = angle - 5
        my_servo.angle = angle
        print("angle: ", angle)
```

### Reflection
I learned more about the basics of Circuit Python, as well as how to use capacative touch and how it can be useful in the future.
